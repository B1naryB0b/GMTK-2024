Humph., Hurrrumph., what do you want?, can't you see I don't want to be bothered? 
alright ALRIGHT, what do you want?, You want to know more about the garden and the little bonsai? I'll tell you but don't be expecting a happy grand ol' tale or anything..., Long before you came along, there was a gardener. That gardener was the one who planted and cared for this little bonsai in the beginning. Then, they brought us to the garden to help nurture the little bonsai., We spent so many days together, working together, caring for our little bonsai and then spending quiet evenings under the stars together. It was if nothing else mattered in the world than us and our little bonsai., But one day...the gardener just stopped coming into the garden. We didn't know what to do., We didn't want to go a day without caring for our little bonsai. What if it wasn't there when the gardener came back?, We knew we had to do all we could to keep the little bonsai alive, not just for the gardener, but for our sake as well., Now here we are, rusty and near useless now. Not much we can do about it. Just how life is Isuppose. 
Don't expect you'll do much for us, but maybe there's something you can do for our little bonsai., Suppose stars got magical properties. I wonder if it had enough stars, it could do something for it, make it bigger and stronger, even just a little. Just a thought...
