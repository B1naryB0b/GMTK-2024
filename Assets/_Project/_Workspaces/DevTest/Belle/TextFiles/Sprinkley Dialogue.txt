Oh hello there! You're a cute little droplet aren't you? Welcome to our little garden., I'm Sprinkley and those two over there are my friends Snippy and Rakey.,Oh what about the tree? That's our beloved bonsai tree. We work hard to keep it nourished and healthy. Don't let its size deceive you, it's been growing for over 20 years now, even before I got here!
Life in our little garden is quite pleasant. After a long day of hard work, we like to gather around and look up at the stars.,Have you ever heard that stars have magical properties? It's true! It's said that with enough star power, anything can live forever. ,Wouldn't it be nice to live forever? Unfortunately, us three don't have much time left and we're not quite sure what will happen to our sweet bonsai tree when we're gone., What if the gardener comes back and it's dead? ,Maybe you could help us out somehow...
Wow the tree is so big, but it dosent look like there are anymore stars to collect, for now!
