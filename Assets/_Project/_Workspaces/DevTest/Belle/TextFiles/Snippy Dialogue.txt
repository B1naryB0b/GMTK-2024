Hiya kid! You're a fresh face in this old place aren't ya? Nice to meet ya, I'm Snippy!
Gosh darn, you're quite slick aren't you! I remember when I was the young one in the garden., Pruning done in the blink of an eye, snip snapping like it was nobody's business!, Now my blades aren't as sharp anymore and my cuts not as crisp...
Us oldies here, we've been through a lot together...especially taking care of our little bonsai there., There were times where we thought it wasn't going to make it. Bonsai are very temperamental y'know., Wouldn't it be great to see our little bonsai get big and live for 100 years like the best ones do?, I don't know how we're going to be able to do that though, we're all on our last legs and I don't see any replacements!
